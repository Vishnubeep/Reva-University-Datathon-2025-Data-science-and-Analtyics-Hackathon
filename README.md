This project builds an explainable user churn-risk scoring pipeline using real-world CSV data from user profiles, usage logs, support tickets, and billing systems, with the goal of identifying users likely to churn and clearly explaining why they are at risk. The pipeline defensively loads and auto-detects columns to handle messy datasets, then creates a master user table with one row per user. It compares two 7-day windows (current vs previous) to detect behavioral changes, especially sudden drops in activity, which are strong churn indicators. From usage data it extracts total usage time, session count, and active days; from support tickets it captures unresolved issues and high-severity problems; and from billing data it tracks payment issues, cancellation requests, inactivity since last login, and monthly charge to reflect revenue impact. Each of these signals is converted into a normalized, interpretable risk component, and combined using a weighted, transparent formula where activity drop and explicit cancellation requests carry the most influence. The final risk score is normalized between 0 and 1, assigned into clear risk tiers (Low, Medium, High, Critical), and paired with a “Primary Reason” that identifies the single strongest contributor to the user’s risk, making the results actionable rather than opaque. The pipeline outputs a full ranked risk report and a Top-100 high-risk user list, designed to be production-safe, easy to audit, and suitable for retention, support prioritization, or executive reporting.
